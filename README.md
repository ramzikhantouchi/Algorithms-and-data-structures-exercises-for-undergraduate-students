# Exercices
Those exercises are designed for beginners who are learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**. The solutions of the exercises are written in C programming language.

## Exercise 1:
Write a C program that prompts users to input their blood type, calculates the frequency and percentage for each blood type, and then display the results along with the total population. The program should exit when the user inputs 'q'.

## Exercise 2:
Two players roll a die. The player with the highest result scores a point. The game stops when one of the players reaches a score of 11. Simulate this game with a C program.

## Exercise 3:
Write a C program to display the first N prime numbers.
Example N = 5, the first 5 prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}

## Exercise 4: 
Write a C program that prompts the user to input 2 integer numbers, then it calculates their greatest common divisor, and display the results.

## Exercise 6: 
Write a C program that prompts the user to input an integer value, and subsequently checks whether the entered value exists in the array of integers named 'Array'.

## Exercise 7:
Write a C program that reverses an array of integers.
Example: input: [1,2,3,4,5].
output: [5,4,3,2,1].

## Exercise 8:
Write a C program that reads the dimension N of an array T of type int (maximum dimension 50) and allows you to:
1. Fill the array with values entered from the keyboard and display the array.
2. Calculate and display the sum of the elements of the array.
3. Determine the largest and smallest value in the array and then display the value and the
position of the maximum and minimum (the program retains the position of the first maximum or minimum encountered).
4. Arrange the elements of the array T in reverse order without using an auxiliary array and display the resulting array.
5. Copy all strictly positive elements into a second array TPOS and all strictly negative values into a third array TNEG. Display the TPOS and TNEG arrays.
## Exercise 9:
1. Write a program that reads the dimensions N and M of two-dimensional arrays A and B of type int (N and M are entered from the keyboard, maximum 50).
2. Fill the array with values entered from the keyboard and display the array along with the sum of all its elements.
3. Perform the addition of the two matrices A and B, remembering that:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d\\
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
e & f\\
g & h\\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
a+e & b+f\\
c+g & d+h\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

4. Calculate the product of two square matrices of the same dimension.
5. Display the number of occurrences of the variable X in both matrices.

## Exercise 10:
Write a program that reads a line of text (not exceeding 200 characters), stores it in a variable
TXT, and then displays:
1. the length L of the string.
2. the number of 'a's contained in the text.
3. the entire sentence in reverse without changing the content of the TXT variable.
4. the entire sentence in reverse after having reversed the order of characters in TXT.

**Example:**
Original: "voici une petite phrase !".

Reversed: "! esarhp etitep enu iciov".
