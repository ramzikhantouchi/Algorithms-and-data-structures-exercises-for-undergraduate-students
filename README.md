# Exercices
Those exercises are designed for beginners who are learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**. The solutions of the exercises are written in C programming language.
Note: For linux users here is how to compile and run a c program

>>gcc filename.c -o filename
>>./filename

## Exercise 1:
Write a C program that prompts users to input their blood type, calculates the frequency and percentage for each blood type, and then display the results along with the total population. The program should exit when the user inputs 'q'.

## Exercise 2:
Two players roll a die. The player with the highest result scores a point. The game stops when one of the players reaches a score of 11. Simulate this game with a C program.

## Exercise 3:
Write a C program to display the first N prime numbers. 
Example N = 5, the first 5 prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
## Exercise 4: 
Write a C program that prompts the user to input 2 integer numbers, then it calculates their greatest common divisor, and display the results.

## Exercise 5: 
Write a C program to sort an array of integers of length N in ascending and descending order.

## Exercise 6: 
Write a C program that prompts the user to input an integer value, and subsequently checks whether the entered value exists in the array of integers named 'Array'.
## Exercise 7:
Write a C program that reverses an array of integers.
Example: input: [1,2,3,4,5].
output: [5,4,3,2,1].
